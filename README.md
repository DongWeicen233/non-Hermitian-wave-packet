Aim of this code: reproduce figures in arXiv:2501.12163

My code can be run in MATLAB (a b c d in code are m a n b in our manuscript, respectively):
please run 'twoD.m' to get FIG. 1. 2D wave-packet dynamics with and without Berry curvature (I use code from line 1 to line 153 to do calculation, but it takes time. Then I save the data, so please run start from line 154)
please run 'PBCmol.m' to get FIG. 3. Band dispersion 
please run 'Berry.m' to get FIG. 4. Chern number and Berry curvature
please run 'OBCmol' to get FIG. 5. Chiral edge states on zigzag edges
please run 'OBC_gaussian.m' to get FIG. 6. Edge wave-packet dynamics
please run 'PBC_gaussian_kxky.m' to get FIG. 8. Bulk wave-packet dynamics (it takes time.)
